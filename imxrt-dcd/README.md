The i.MX RT1050/1060 series of MCUs feature a ROM bootloader. As a part of the boot process, it interprets the Device Configuration Data (DCD) section in the firmware image to perform limited initialization and validation of peripheral registers, e.g. to set up external memory controllers, before any ARM instructions from the firmware image is run.

This crate allows you to generate a DCD binary (byte array) from its semantic description. This is useful e.g. in a `build.rs` script to generate a static variable to be linked to the firmware image. (Shameless plug: See [static-include-bytes](https://crates.io/crates/static-include-bytes).)

# What does the DCD do exactly?

Reference: i.MX RT1060 Reference Manual (rev. 3), ยง9.7.2 .

The DCD section in the firmware image is a serialized byte array of one or more commands:

- **Write**: Write value (1/2/4-byte) to address.
  - `*address = value` --- direct write
  - `*address &= !value` --- read-modify-write clear bits
  - `*address |= value` --- read-modify-write set bits

- **Check**: Read from address until the value satisfies the condition or too many attempts.
  - `(*address & mask) == 0` --- all clear
  - `(*address & mask) == mask` --- all set
  - `(*address & mask) != mask` --- any clear
  - `(*address & mask) != 0` --- any set

- **NOP**: Ignored (might act as a delay?)

## Write command compression

Multiple Write commands with the same bit width and operation (i.e. write/clear/set) can be merged (sharing the same command header) to save some bytes. This might be helpful as there is a hardcoded byte length limit in the ROM (1768 bytes for RT1060, including headers).

This crate automatically performs this compression but does _not_ enforce any byte size limit.

## Valid Write command address ranges

The ROM only allows Write commands to a limited number of address ranges:

| Begin       | End (inclusive) | Description            |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 0x400A_4000 | 0x400A_7FFF     | IOMUX Control SNVS GPR |
| 0x400A_8000 | 0x400A_BFFF     | IOMUX Control SNVS     |
| 0x400A_C000 | 0x400A_FFFF     | IOMUX Control GPR      |
| 0x401F_8000 | 0x401F_BFFF     | IOMUX Control          |
| 0x400D_8000 | 0x400D_BFFF     | CCM Analog             |
| 0x400F_C000 | 0x400F_FFFF     | CCM                    |
| 0x402F_0000 | 0x402F_3FFF     | SEMC                   |

Writing to anywhere outside these ranges will cause the ROM to **immediately abandon interpreting the rest of your DCD**.

Again, this crate does _not_ enforce any address range limitations.

## Check command polling count 

The Check command may specify one of the following:

- Omitted max polling count: ROM will poll indefinitely as long as the condition remains unsatisfied.
- max polling count == 0: Equivalent to NOP.
- max polling count > 0: If the max polling count is hit, the ROM will **immediately abandon interpreting the rest of your DCD**.

Note that the ROM does _not_ seem to limit the address range of Check commands.

# Toy Example

```rust
use imxrt_dcd::*;

let mut buf = std::io::Cursor::new(vec![]);
let byte_len = serialize(
    &mut buf,
    &[
        Command::Nop,
        Command::Write(Write {
            width: Width::B4,
            op: WriteOp::Write,
            address: 0x01234567,
            value: 0xdeadbeef,
        }),
        Command::Check(Check {
            width: Width::B2,
            cond: CheckCond::AnySet,
            address: 0x89abcdef,
            mask: 0x55aa55aa,
            count: Some(16),
        }),
        Command::Check(Check {
            width: Width::B1,
            cond: CheckCond::AnyClear,
            address: 0x89abcdef,
            mask: 0x55aa55aa,
            count: None,
        }),
    ],
)
.expect("IO failure");
assert_eq!(byte_len, 48);
assert_eq!(
    &buf.get_ref()[0..48],
    &[
        // DCD header
        0xD2, 0, 48, 0x41,
        // nop
        0xC0, 0x00, 0x04, 0x00,
        // write
        0xCC, 0, 12, 0x04, 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef,
        // check with count
        0xCF, 0, 16, 0x1a, 0x89, 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x55, 0xaa, 0x55, 0xaa, 0, 0, 0, 16,
        // check without
        0xCF, 0, 12, 0x09, 0x89, 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x55, 0xaa, 0x55, 0xaa,
    ]
);
